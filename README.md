# Smart Water Monitoring System with WatsonX

The goal is to model virtual sensors to determine water levels based on existing sensor reports in nearby proximity.

## Components:

### Water Sensors: 
 *  These are electronic devices placed at various depths and locations in a water body.
 *  They measure the water level.

### Communication Module: 
  * This sends data from the water sensors to a central server.
  * It can be a wired or wireless system.

### WatsonX Analytics Platform: 
  * A cloud-based system that receives, stores, and analyzes the data from the sensors.

## USGS Sensor

This is a USGS stream sensor that reports water levels via NOAA Satellite.

## GreenStream Sensor

This is a GreenStream Sensor that reports water level via LoRa/LoRaWAN or GSM.

## Procedure:

Sensor Installation: 
  * The water sensors are strategically installed in the water body.
  * They continuously measure the water level and transmit this data to the WatsonX platform through the communication module.

Data Analysis: 
  * As data streams in, WatsonX processes it and determines the current water level trends.

Predictive Analytics: 
  * WatsonX uses historical data and current measurements to predict future water levels, identifying potential flood risks or drought conditions.

Alerts & Reporting: 
  * If the system identifies any anomalies or predicts potential issues, it sends alerts to concerned authorities or stakeholders. This allows them to take preventive measures.
